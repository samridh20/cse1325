FULL CREDIT

NOTE: These are measurements which may vary plus your opinions which may vary a LOT. We won't grade for "correctness", just completeness.

QUESTION 1: What Boggle command line arguments ([#boards] and if not default [boardSize])did you use to achieve a 30 to 45 second runtime? Note: We're only interested in the "real" seconds for this question.


time java Boggle 



QUESTION 2: Provide the full output (including the time command) for your program, with 1 to 16 threads. **Ensure that the result is the same for all 16 runs.** With bash, you can run all of these with a single command if you like, replacing "90" with whatever Boggle command line arguments you identified in QUESTION 1: 

for i in {1..16} ; do echo ; echo $i Threads; time java Boggle 90 - $i ; done

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?

Increasing the threads reduces the time at first but later the time starts increasing because of thread overhead and limited cores

QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?

Yes, adding more threads increased the system load. This is because with more threads operating system needs to perform more context switching.






BONUS
=====

QUESTION 5: Time your version of Boggle as you did for the full credit version. Is this additional layer of threading faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? Why?

adding another layer of threading is faster than full credit because thread pool reduces idle time for threads making better use of CPU
